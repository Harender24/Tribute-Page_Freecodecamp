        <h3 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam's life</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1931</strong>: Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1955</strong>: Kalam moved to Madras to study aerospace engineering in Madras
            Institute of Technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1960</strong>: Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the
            Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
            Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member
            of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his
            career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by
            his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR
            committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space
            scientist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1963</strong>: In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in
            Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
            Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1965</strong>: Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
            independently at DRDO in 1965.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1969</strong>: In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's
            first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed
            the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1970</strong>: Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop
            the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both
            of which proved to be successful.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1970</strong>: In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil
            and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from
            the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the
            disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
            allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her
            discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship. Kalam played an
            integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true
            nature of these classified aerospace projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1981</strong>: The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in
            1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990 for his work with ISRO and DRDO
            and his role as a scientific advisor to the Government.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1992</strong>: Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime
            Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development
            Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear
            tests were conducted during this period in which he played an
            intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the
            Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during
            the testing phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made
            him the country's best known nuclear scientist. However, the
            director of the site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear
            bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticisied Kalam for issuing an
            incorrect report. Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1997</strong>: In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the
            Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and
            modernisation of defence technology in India.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1998</strong>: In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a
            low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2002</strong>: Kalam became the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R.
            Narayanan.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2015</strong>: On 30 July 2015, the former President was laid to rest at
            Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state honours. Over
            350,000 people attended the last rites, including the Prime
            Minister, the governor of Tamil Nadu and the chief ministers of
            Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.
